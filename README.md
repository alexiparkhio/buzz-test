# Buzz test (Loctite landing page)
## Description
This is a small project I did for Buzz Marketing Networks. Features a responsive landing page example for *Loctite* products. I would like to thank in advance to Buzz Marketing Networks for the interest in my software competencies.

## Initialization
The best way to open the project is to first install *Live Server* on the Visual Studio Code editor. Any of this resources is completely free:

Afterwards, simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select *Open with Live Server* . Live server ensures that not only the file will load all resources attached to it, but it also will listen to changes on it or on its dependencies.
