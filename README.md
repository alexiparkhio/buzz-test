# Loctite responsive landing page
## Description
This is a small project I did for a company. Features a responsive landing page example for *Loctite* products. I would like to thank in advance to the company for the interest in my software competencies. 

The landing page focuses on being fully responsive and senseful in both mobile and desktop screen sizes. While the desktop design is the one I was meant to replicate, the mobile one was improvised.

NOTE: `mediaqueries-switch` branch features the same project refactored with the mediaqueries' setup switched (i.e. mobile-first)

## Initialization
The best way to open the project is to first install *Live Server* on the Visual Studio Code editor. Any of these resources are completely free: 

![Live Server](/assets/doc/live-server.png)

Afterwards, simply right-click on the `index.html` file and select *Open with Live Server* . Live server ensures that not only the file will load all resources attached to it, but it also will listen to changes on it or on its dependencies.
